# Rubber Ducking

Rubber ducking is the practice of explaining a problem out loud, step by step, as if you were teaching it to someone else. The term comes from a story about a programmer who carried a rubber duck and explained code to it until the solution revealed itself.  

When you talk through a problem, the act of organizing your thoughts often exposes gaps in your understanding or sparks new connections. Rubber-ducking shows that someone does not need to be more experienced than you to help you solve your problems. They just need to be present and engaged.  

While the traditional *rubber duck* is an inanimate object, *people* can also be rubber ducks when they embrace the role of listener. *AI* has also taken on the role of rubber duck in more recent times.
