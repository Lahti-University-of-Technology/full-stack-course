# Course Manual Outline

- Introduction
  - This course will teach you how to build software by shipping a public full stack project and reflecting on the process.
- Course Principles
  - Empathy: build with users and peers in mind; meet regularly as mentor and mentee [../assignments/37-mentor-meeting.md].
  - Transparency: commit and deploy often; keep history public [../docs/ethics.md#git-commit-history].
  - Direct Communication: document decisions plainly in README, issues, and commits.
  - Originality: write your own code, disclose help in `AI_USAGE.md`, and keep work explainable [../docs/ethics.md#general-expectations].
- Project Overview
  - Description of the main course project: a non trivial MVP using Node v22, SvelteKit, and Netlify; see [Course Project](../assignments/48-course-project.md).
  - Expectations and constraints: public GitHub repo named `fsd-project-2025`, public deploy, ethical data, steady commits.
  - Client server architecture requirement: separate browser client and server API backed by a database.
  - Continuous progress and visibility: weekly milestones and deploys starting with the setup assignment [../assignments/36-setup-development-platform.md].
- Milestones and Deadlines
  - Definition and purpose of milestones: break the project into reviewable steps that show incremental progress.
  - List of example milestones:
    - Brainstorm project ideas: gather options and compare similar work.
    - Choose a project: decide and document scope.
    - Design user experience: sketch flows and paper prototypes [paper-prototype.md].
    - Plan architecture: outline data flow and components [course-project-how-to.md].
    - Choose stack and host: confirm Node, SvelteKit, and Netlify setup [../assignments/36-setup-development-platform.md].
    - Deploy Hello World: push a live build from the main branch [../assignments/36-setup-development-platform.md].
    - Add CI/CD: automate tests and deploys with GitHub and Netlify.
    - Implement API and database: connect routes to a persistent store.
    - Frontend implementation: build Svelte components and state with XState.
    - Final deployment and presentation: ship the MVP and demo it.
    - First milestone: public deployment: prove setup with a live URL.
- Evaluation Criteria
  - Clear and consistent commit history: no big bang dumps, no rewrites [../docs/ethics.md#git-commit-history].
  - Full stack architecture: browser client, API, and database working together.
  - Publicly accessible source code: repository visible on GitHub.
  - Secure handling of secrets: rotate them and never commit `.env` files [../docs/ethics.md#data-responsibility].
  - Stable and consistent repositories: no force pushes or repo resets.
  - Non trivial project scope: deliver an MVP that solves a real problem.
  - Originality: code and content are your own.
  - Presentation and documentation: README, diagrams, and commit messages explain the project.
  - Peer and instructor evaluations: classmates and staff review progress.
- Resources and Tools
  - Recommended reading and reference materials: start with [“From Data to Wisdom”](../assignments/36-read-ackoff-from-data-to-wisdom.md) and other [foundational writings on data](data-foundational-writings-on-data.md).
  - Tools for development, version control, deployment, and testing: Node v22, SvelteKit, GitHub, Netlify, XState, and testing frameworks like Vitest.
  - Case studies and external articles: see [course project how to](course-project-how-to.md) and [datasets and open source sources](datasets-open-source.md) for examples.
