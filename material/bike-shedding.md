# Bike-Shedding

*Bike-shedding* describes the tendency for people to spend more time on trivial issues than on complex or important ones.

The name comes from a story about a committee that quickly approved the design of a nuclear power plant, but then argued at length over the color of its bike shed—because everyone felt confident enough to have an opinion about the shed, but not the reactor.  

The lesson is to be alert to when discussions drift toward the easy and familiar instead of the hard and meaningful. Bike-shedding wastes time, drains energy, and creates the illusion of progress while avoiding real decisions.  

For software engineers, recognizing bike-shedding is key. A lead can help by noticing when a conversation lingers too long on a detail that doesn’t matter, and gently steering back to the central problem. A junior can help by pausing to ask: *Is this discussion about the core issue, or are we stuck on the bike shed?*

## The Tale of the Bike Shed

Once upon a time, a great council was called to decide on the building of a mighty power plant. The plant was vast, complicated, and dangerous, yet the councilors nodded in agreement and passed the plan without hesitation.  

Then someone mentioned a small shed where the workers might leave their bicycles. At once, every councilor leaned forward. Should it be green, or red, or perhaps blue with white trim? Voices rose, arguments stretched on, and the meeting ran late into the night—all over a shed no bigger than a stable.  

And so the power plant was approved in minutes, but the bike shed took hours.  

This is why we say *bike-shedding*: the easier the problem, the more people feel entitled to debate it. The harder the problem, the quicker it is waved through.
