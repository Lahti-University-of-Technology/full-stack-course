# Coalition Collaboration

As part of this course, you will work not only on your own project but also as a member of a coalition. Your responsibility is to contribute actively, share ideas openly, and support the progress of others. Participation is expected and factored into your evaluation.

## What is a Coalition?

A coalition is a small group of students formed to provide mutual support throughout the course. Each member pursues their own individual project, but the coalition exists to create shared accountability, encourage collaboration, and cross-pollinate ideas.

## High-Level Role of the Coalition

Coalitions are not group projects. They are a network of peers who check in on each other, share insights, and provide constructive feedback. The coalition framework ensures no student works in isolation and that every student benefits from the perspective of others.

## Meetings

- There will be **four mandatory coalition meetings** during the semester.  
- All members must attend these mandatory meetings **in person**. Use a scheduling tool such as <https://rallly.co> to find a time.  
- In addition, you are encouraged to meet **weekly**. These optional meetings may be in person or via live video (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Meet).  

### Weekly Meetings

Weekly meetings should begin with a [standup meeting](https://geekbot.com/blog/daily-standup-meeting/). This should last no longer than 15 minutes.

In a standup meeting, each member in turn tells the group:  

1. What they accomplished in the past week.  
2. What they plan to do over the coming week.  
3. What, if any, *blockers* exist. Blockers are anything that prevents accomplishing the upcoming goals: hardware problems, scheduling conflicts, or lack of knowledge.  

After the scrum, the rest of the meeting is up to the coalition. Some members may leave. Others may stay to collaborate, discuss issues, or help with blockers.  

### Brainstorming Meeting

The first meeting of the coalition will be a [brainstorming session](/assignments/36-brainstorm-coalition.md). This is a fast-paced, round-robin activity focused on generating a pool of ideas that everyone can draw on, without judgment or ownership.  

### Retrospectives

The next three meetings of the coalition will be retrospectives:  

- [Week 40 Retrospective](/assignments/40-coalition-retrospective.md)  
- [Week 44 Retrospective](/assignments/44-coalition-retrospective.md)  
- [Week 51 Retrospective](/assignments/51-coalition-retrospective.md)  

Each retrospective has a distinct purpose tied to the stage of the semester, but all focus on reflecting, sharing progress, surfacing challenges, and supporting each other toward completion.
