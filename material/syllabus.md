Developing idea into MVP, clear communication in engineering, commit messages as example, what is a good experience, Diagrams: thinking vs communication, Why is planning and documentation important?, User Experience intro, a11y, persona, IA, job story, task flow, wireframes and wireflow, states and visual indications, not a UXD course, but necessary to understand UXD principles and documents, ui intro, uxd vs ui, 

## 38
project description sharing, data, data modeling, architecture, context diagram, c4 model, api necessary consequence of client/server architecture, data model vs api resource, DFD, development methodologies, TDD, intro to testing, how testing helps

## 39
uxd sharing, components, api serverless, databases, document vs. relational, ERD vs document schema, programming practices, OO vs fp, principles of visual design, design framework

## 40
Architecture (DFD, C4 diagrams) sharing, UI wireframes sharing, Visual design workshop, intro to state management, why state is hard, programming practice: functions, modules, cohesion/coupling, error handling

## 41
Frontend implementation: components, props, events, reusability, connecting mock data, intro to backend implementation: Netlify functions, routing, request/response cycle, REST conventions, programming practice: abstraction, interfaces, contracts

## 42
Frontend–backend integration, API endpoints tested with Postman/curl, connecting to persistence (Supabase/Mongo), validation and constraints, local vs external storage, asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await), error handling strategies, testing deeper: unit tests vs integration tests

## 43
Mid-semester exams, review and synthesis, code walkthroughs, project milestone check-in

## 44
Period 2 begins: from MVP toward robustness, iterative development, refactoring code smells, technical debt, code reviews as practice, collaboration patterns, version control workflows (branches, PRs)

## 45
Testing at scale: mocking, fixtures, coverage, CI pipelines, frontend testing libraries, backend endpoint tests, state management revisited with XState, visualizing state machines, applying state machines to UI flows
