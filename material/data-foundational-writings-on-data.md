# Foundational Writings on Data: A Thematic Bibliography

## 1. Definition and Concept of Data  

- **Ackoff, Russell (1989). “From Data to Wisdom.”** *Journal of Applied Systems Analysis 16: 3–9.* – A classic paper in which Ackoff delineates the hierarchy from raw data up to wisdom. He defines *data* as mere symbols representing properties of objects/events , distinguishing it from processed *information* and higher levels of understanding. This influential work is widely cited for clarifying what “data” means in information science and knowledge management, making it foundational for any conceptual discussion of data .  
- **Gleick, James (2011). *The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood*.** New York: Pantheon Books. – A sweeping historical and conceptual study of information (and by extension data). Gleick chronicles how the very notion of *data* and information evolved – from African drumming and Morse code to Claude Shannon’s information theory. The book provides educators with context on how data came to be defined and measured (e.g. Shannon’s 1948 formulation of information in binary digits ) and why data underpins modern digital society. It’s a highly accessible yet authoritative resource on the meaning and significance of data as “information, in formation.”  

## 2. Historical Use of Data (Early Writing Systems and Record-Keeping)  

- **Schmandt-Besserat, Denise (1986). “The Origins of Writing.”** *Scientific American 254(6): 50–58.* – Archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat’s seminal work on Mesopotamian clay tokens shows how record-keeping *predated* written language. She demonstrates that for thousands of years before cuneiform, clay counters were used to represent goods, essentially an early *data recording system* for accounting  .  
- **Graunt, John (1662). *Natural and Political Observations... upon the Bills of Mortality*.** – A landmark 17th-century analysis of data for public health. Graunt compiled London death records and extracted patterns, effectively creating the first statistical *analysis* of public data .  
- **Hollerith, Herman (1889). “An Electric Tabulating System.”** *Columbia University Quarterly 10(16): 238–255.* – Hollerith’s paper describes his punched-card tabulating machine, which revolutionized data processing for the 1890 U.S. Census. *“Marks the beginning of the era of mechanized ... data processing”* .  

## 3. Types of Data (Structured, Unstructured, Semi-Structured)  

- **Codd, E. F. (1970). “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.”** *Communications of the ACM 13(6): 377–387.* – The paper that launched structured data management, introducing the relational model  .  
- **Abiteboul, Serge; Buneman, Peter; Suciu, Dan (1999). *Data on the Web: From Relations to Semistructured Data and XML*.** Morgan Kaufmann. – Influential book on semi-structured data, XML, and web data foundations  .  
- **Salton, Gerald (1968). *Automatic Information Organization and Retrieval*.** Prentice-Hall. – Pioneering text in information retrieval and unstructured data handling.  

## 4. Data Collection Methods (Manual, Automated, Crowd-Sourced)  

- **Snow, John (1855). *On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (2nd ed.)*** – Famous Broad Street pump case; an exemplar of manual data collection and visualization .  
- **Hollerith, Herman (1889). “An Electric Tabulating System.”** – Automated census data collection using punch cards .  
- **Surowiecki, James (2004). *The Wisdom of Crowds*.** Doubleday. – Explains how aggregated crowd data can be accurate; cites Galton’s 1907 ox-weighing experiment .  

## 5. Data Communication (Formats, Protocols, APIs)  

- **Shannon, Claude (1948). “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.”** *Bell System Technical Journal 27(3).* – Foundational paper in information theory, defining bits and channel capacity  .  
- **Cerf, Vint & Kahn, Robert (1974). “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.”** *IEEE Transactions on Communications 22(5): 637–648.* – TCP/IP paper .  
- **Fielding, Roy (2000). *Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures* (Chapter 5: REST).** – Introduces REST principles for web APIs .  

## 6. Data Storage (Filesystems, Databases, Redundancy)  

- **Codd, E. F. (1970). “A Relational Model of Data…”** – Cornerstone for relational databases .  
- **Patterson, David; Gibson, Garth; Katz, Randy (1988). “A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID).”** *SIGMOD 1988.* – Introduces RAID levels for redundancy and performance .  
- **Ghemawat, Sanjay; Gobioff, Howard; Leung, Shun-Tak (2003). “The Google File System.”** *SOSP 2003.* – Foundational paper on distributed storage .  

## 7. Data Usage (Analytics, Personalization, Prediction)  

- **Tukey, John W. (1962). “The Future of Data Analysis.”** *Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33(1): 1–67.* – Defines data analysis as its own discipline .  
- **Fayyad, Usama; Piatetsky-Shapiro, Gregory; Smyth, Padhraic (1996). “From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases.”** *AI Magazine 17(3): 37–54.* – Establishes KDD and data mining processes .  
- **Breiman, Leo (2001). “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.”** *Statistical Science 16(3): 199–231.* – Influential essay contrasting data vs. algorithmic modeling .  

## 8. Philosophical Perspectives on Data (Data as a Map, Not Truth)  

- **Korzybski, Alfred (1933). *Science and Sanity.*** – Origin of “the map is not the territory” .  
- **Box, George (1979). “Robustness in the strategy of scientific model building.”** – Famous maxim: “All models are wrong, but some are useful” .  
- **Kent, William (1978). *Data and Reality*.** – Classic on the philosophical challenges of data modeling .  
- **Gitelman, Lisa (ed.) (2013). *“Raw Data” Is an Oxymoron*.** MIT Press. – Essays on data as always constructed, never “raw” .
