# Course Mentorship Guidelines

## Peer Mentorship Overview

In this course, each student will participate in a peer mentorship system to enhance collaboration and mutual support.

## Mentor Assignment

- You will be assigned to be a *mentor* to one fellow student in the class (who is your *mentee*)
- You will also be assigned a mentor.
- If you have been assigned a mentor who also happens to be your mentee, this is a mistake. Please notify the instructor.

## Meeting Requirements

- Conduct four check-in meetings with your mentee over the course of the project timeline.
- Document the date and a brief summary of each meeting.
- These meetings should be face-to-face.

## Providing Feedback

- Use the provided feedback checklist to give your mentee constructive, actionable input.
- Focus on helping them stay on track and overcome any challenges they encounter.

## Engagement and Reflection

- At the end of the project, submit a short reflection on your mentorship experience, noting any successes or difficulties.

## Grading Criteria

- Your mentorship grade will be based on completing the required meetings, following the feedback process, and submitting your final reflection.
