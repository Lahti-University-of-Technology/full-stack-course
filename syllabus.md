- *First Day of Class – Full Stack Development Course* (Week 36)
  - *Opening and Tone-Setting*
    - Instructor introduction
      - Who I am, background, interests, why I'm teaching
      - "Sergeant training officers"
    - Course introduction
      - What full stack development means in this course
      - End results:
        - Build and own a full stack application
        - Understand how the frontend, backend, database, and deployment all fit together
        - Learn to use modern tools, workflows and technologies that professional developers rely on
        - Practice communicating your design and technical decisions clearly
      - Programming and development as creative expression
        - Creative and bold
        - Conservative and cautious
    - Course philosophy
      - Ethics, people, principles first
      - More like a *studio class* than a seminar
        - Open-ended questions over rote memorization
        - Focus on exploration, design decisions, rationale, experimentation

  - *Course Assignments and Grading*
    - Course Project
      - Milestones
      - Weekly progress reports
      - Evaluation and Presentation
    - Weekly Assignments
      - Intended to be in support of course project
    - Semester Topic Report
      - Become a subject-matter expert on something related to Full Stack development
    - Affinity group meetings

  - *Expectations*
    - Course manual has deeper details
    - Brief overview
      - Definition of fair and correct
        - Do not present another person's work as your own.
          - You may use AI tools.
          - You may ask friends for advice or help understanding a problem.
          - But every assignment and all source code must be **authored by you**.
          - If you incorporate someone else's code (even a small snippet), you must give proper credit.
            - Giving credit does not make it acceptable to outsource major parts of the project.
            - Example: having a friend write your frontend and then crediting them is **not acceptable**.
        - Your project's git commit history is a transparent record of your work
          - It cannot be faked
          - A sudden burst of commits producing a finished project is a red flag and will fail
          - Other red flags that indicate cheating include:
            - Deleting and recreating repositories
            - Getting banned from GitHub
            - Pointing course URLs to private repositories
          - The only way to have a clean history is steady, honest progress on your own original work
    - Ethos
      - Honesty over perfection
      - Struggling openly is better than pretending everything is fine
      - You *must* communicate disappointments, criticisms, and ideas about the course, class, and teaching style to me as directly as you can
        - Thoughts on cultural differences
          - New York City, Finland, Northern Europe
            - Direct, unvarnished criticism (seen as efficient and transparent)
            - Flattened hierarchy (everybody is equal)
            - Direct eye contact (seen as respectful and attentive)
          - You *might* be more used to:
            - Avoiding criticism of teachers, bosses, elders
            - Criticism couched in polite language or indirect phrasing ("perhaps you could reconsider..." or even "everything is fine...")
            - Avoiding eye contact with strangers or authorities (seen as respectful rather than evasive)

  - *Break*

  - *Students*

      - [assignment](assignments/36-setup-development-platform.md)
    - Submit *one deep question* you want answered about full stack development (due week 37)
      - Example questions (but you cannot use these):
        - How can full stack architectures scale from one user to millions?
        - What does it mean for an app to be secure across the stack?
        - Why is managing state across the stack so difficult?
        - What trade-offs do frameworks make beneath the surface?
        - What CS fundamentals matter most for full stack work?

  - *Closing*
    - Questions
    - Course as collaborative exploration
    - Curiosity, transparency, and steady progress
