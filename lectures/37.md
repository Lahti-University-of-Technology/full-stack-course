# Week 37

## Greetings

## Data

Without data there is no software. It is worth taking some time to think about it.

### What is data?

<details><summary>- Let's have a socratic dialogue and ask ourselves: What is data?</summary>
  <details><summary>  - If we go to a forest and see scratches on a tree, are those scratches *data*?</summary>
    <details><summary>    - Is the tree *itself* data?</summary>
      <details><summary>  - When a tree falls in the forest, is the sound it makes *data*?</summary>
        <details><summary>    - Is no one hears the sound, is the sound *data*?</summary>
          <details><summary>  - If I hear a sound and then tell you about it, is that *data*?</summary>
            <details><summary>  - Does *data* need to be *useful*, in order to be considered *data*?</summary>
              <details><summary>  - data => information => knowledge => wisdom?</summary>
                <details><summary>- My pet theory is that civilization would not exist without data. The first writing systems were not poetry, but record-keeping.</summary>
                - <details><summary>Working definition of data: </summary>    Data is anything observed <i>and recorded.</i>  </details

#### Is "data" singular or plural?

  *It's a minor point, but worth taking a look. Does one say "data is" or "data are"? In academic and scientific contexts, people tend to use "data are..." and "datum" as the singular. Say it whichever way you feel comfortable! I tend to use it in the singular, as an uncountable noun, e.g. "some data is"!* [^1]

### Uses of data

In-class discussion: how can data be used and abused?

<details><summary>Unusual or unexpected examples</summary>
<b>Proxy measures </b>:  artificial light at night from satellites is used as a proxy for GDP growth.

<b>Exhaust data </b>:  server logs, clickstreams, or even printer queues: collected as a side effect, later mined for insight.

<b>Data repurposing </b>:  Data such as Fitbit step counts being used in court cases. [^2]

<b>Data inversion </b>:  not what’s present, but what’s missing; e.g. censorship gaps, silence on social media, or a blank field in a form.

<b>Synthetic data </b>:  invented data used to train models when real data is sensitive or scarce.

<b>Future data </b>:  predicted data (e.g. weather forecasts, stock price simulations) treated and acted upon as if it already exists.

#### OSINT, metadata and data leakage

##### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

- Social media posts — tracking movements of soldiers or aid workers from photos or check-ins.
- Satellite imagery — counting cars in parking lots to estimate retail sales, or aircraft on runways to track military activity.
- Job postings — revealing what technologies or facilities a company or government agency is working on.
- Shipping and flight data — AIS (ships) and ADS-B (planes) signals broadcast openly; used to monitor smuggling, troop movements, or supply chains.
- Public records — court filings, procurement contracts, property records exposing hidden connections.
- Metadata leaks — EXIF data in a photo showing GPS coordinates; document revision histories revealing authorship.

I do not know much about OSINT, but there lots of YouTube videos willing to teach you: <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=osint+course>

I have not watched these nor do I guarantee anything at all about these courses.

For example:

##### Metadata

*Metadata* is data about data. It describes the characteristics, context, or structure of the underlying information, without being the content itself.

- Phone calls → caller, recipient, time, duration, location (but not the conversation).
- Email → sender, recipients, timestamp.
- Photographs → resolution, camera type, GPS coordinates, time taken (but not the image).
- Files → size, format, creation date, last modified (but not the file’s text or images).

##### Data leakage and data breaches

*Data leakage* is when data is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties. It usually happens not by a direct hack, but by oversight, misconfiguration, or secondary effects.

Examples:

- A misconfigured cloud storage bucket left public, exposing sensitive files.
- Source code accidentally pushed to GitHub containing passwords or API keys.
- Employees forwarding internal documents to personal email.
- Machine learning models “memorizing” training data (like names, addresses) and regurgitating it.
- Side-channel leaks: timing, error messages, or logs that reveal more than intended.

It’s useful to contrast with data breach:

*Data breach* is when protected or confidential information is accessed by unauthorized parties, usually through intrusion or attack.

Examples:

- Hackers breaking into a hospital system and stealing patient records.
- Ransomware attackers copying company files before encrypting them.
- A phishing attack that tricks an employee into revealing login credentials, leading to exposure of customer databases.
- Exploiting a software vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection) to dump sensitive tables.

#### Ethics, privacy, security and data

Here are different scenarios to discuss.

  *Metadata* is not a recording of phone calls, but who called whom, when, and how long. Cell tower data can also track when and where a phone was located.

- Government collects phone call metadata and uses it to
  - Catch criminals
  - Disrupt foreign terrorist cells
  - Monitor political dissidents
  - Track opposition leaders

- Private company collects customer data, sells it to another organization, which uses it for
  - Targeted advertising
  - Finding wealthy, elderly people for scams
  - Offering companionship to lonely people
  - Catfishing lonely people

- Other scenarios
  - Shadow profiles
  - Customer acquisition funnels
  - AI personal data analysis

### Open source datasets

### Data visualization

### Data and software

Proposition: *all software manipulates and presents data and there is no other kind of software.*

Is that true?

- Does this definition work for *control systems*, say, firmware guiding a rocket?

Maybe, depending on the definition of *present data*?  It's not really *presenting* data, like on a monitor. But it is using data.

- How about? *All software manipulates and* uses *data*

*Use* feels too vague. It's not saying anything important. What if we stick an \* asterisk next to *present* and use that as a working definition?

*All software manipulates and presents\* data*

\* *if you define* presents *broadly*

### Assignment

- Locate an interesting dataset and explore it.

What is GitHub?

### Notes

#### "Data" singular vs. plural

[^1]: The *data is / data are* split is a textbook case of how **Latin plurals** and **English usage** diverged over time.

- **Latin origin**: *Datum* (“something given”) is singular; *data* is the plural. In Latin, you’d unambiguously say “the data are.”
- **Early English adoption** (17th–18th c.): Scholars borrowed *datum/data* in scientific and mathematical writing, keeping the Latin singular/plural distinction. “These data are…” was standard in formal contexts.
- **Shift in common usage** (19th–20th c.): As *data* came to mean “information” in the aggregate, English speakers increasingly treated it as a **mass noun**, like *sand* or *water*. That made “the data is…” natural in everyday and technical speech.
- **Modern split**:

  - **Academic/scientific style guides** (esp. in the UK, sciences, and older traditions) still prefer *data are* with *datum* as singular.
  - **General and computing/industry usage** overwhelmingly favors *data is*, treating it as an uncountable noun (“some data,” “a piece of data”).
  - Major style guides diverge: APA now allows *data is*; Nature and Science stick with *data are*.

Etymologically, it’s the same trajectory as *agenda* (Latin plural of *agendum*, “thing to be done”), which in modern English is treated as a singular (“the agenda is set”).

So:

- If you’re writing **formal academic science**, “data are” aligns with tradition.
- In **general, technical, or computing contexts**, “data is” has become the unmarked form.

#### "Fitbit Murder" Case

[^2]: In 2015, Connie Dabate was found murdered in her Connecticut home. Her husband, Richard Dabate, claimed that an intruder broke in, shot her, and tied him up. However, data from Connie’s Fitbit told a different story: the tracker revealed she was moving around—well after the time Richard claimed she had been fatally attacked.

Trial and verdict

Investigators used these movements to challenge Richard’s timeline. He was eventually convicted in 2022 and sentenced to 65 years in prison
