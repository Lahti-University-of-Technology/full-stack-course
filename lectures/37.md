# Week 37

- Course overview 2
  - Course philosophy
    - Ethics, people, principles first
    - More like a *studio class* than a seminar
      - Open-ended questions over rote memorization
      - Focus on exploration, design decisions, rationale, experimentation
  - Ethos
    - Honesty over perfection
    - Struggling openly is better than pretending everything is fine
    - You *must* communicate disappointments, criticisms, and ideas about the course, class, and teaching style to me as directly as you can
      - Thoughts on cultural differences
        - New York City, Finland, Northern Europe
          - Direct, unvarnished criticism (seen as efficient and transparent)
          - Flattened hierarchy (everybody is equal)
          - Direct eye contact (seen as respectful and attentive)
        - You *might* be more used to:
          - Avoiding criticism of teachers, bosses, elders
          - Criticism couched in polite language or indirect phrasing ("perhaps you could reconsider..." or even "everything is fine...")
          - Avoiding eye contact with strangers or authorities (seen as respectful rather than evasive)
