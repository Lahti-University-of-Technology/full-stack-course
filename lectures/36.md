# Week 36 - Full Stack Development

- **Welcome**
  - Instructor introduction
    - Who I am, background, interests, why I'm teaching
    - "Sergeant training officers"
  - **Course overview**
    - *"This course will teach you how to build software."*
      - Hard skills versus soft skills versus theory?
    - What full stack development means in this course
      - Terms: layers? stack? separation of concerns? backend? frontend? API? version control?
    - End results:
      - Build and own a full stack application
      - Understand how the frontend, backend, database, and deployment all fit together
      - Learn to use modern tools, workflows and technologies that professional developers rely on
      - Practice communicating your design and technical decisions clearly
    - Programming and development as creative expression
      - Creative and bold
      - Conservative and cautious
    - Self-learning course
      - see [resources](/material/resources.md)
      - All engineers are self-taught
        - We encounter problems and propose solutions that have never been tried before, often under tight deadlines
        - It is a very fast-moving industry. All hard knowledge that I impart to you will be obsolete soon.
      - This course will not cover basic programming
      - see [/material/resources.md](/material/resources.md)
  - Course philosophy
    - Ethics, people, principles first
    - More like a *studio class* than a seminar
      - Open-ended questions over rote memorization
      - Focus on exploration, design decisions, rationale, experimentation
  - Ethos
    - Honesty over perfection
    - Struggling openly is better than pretending everything is fine
    - You *must* communicate disappointments, criticisms, and ideas about the course, class, and teaching style to me as directly as you can
      - Thoughts on cultural differences
        - New York City, Finland, Northern Europe
          - Direct, unvarnished criticism (seen as efficient and transparent)
          - Flattened hierarchy (everybody is equal)
          - Direct eye contact (seen as respectful and attentive)
        - You *might* be more used to:
          - Avoiding criticism of teachers, bosses, elders
          - Criticism couched in polite language or indirect phrasing ("perhaps you could reconsider..." or even "everything is fine...")
          - Avoiding eye contact with strangers or authorities (seen as respectful rather than evasive)

- **How to succeed in this course**
  The course manual explains details, but the core ideas:
  - Fair and correct work means your project and work is genuinely yours.
    - Use AI tools to explore, learn, write and accelerate — as long as you understand what they produce.
    - Ask friends for advice or to help you think through a problem — learning from others is part of the process.
    - Every assignment and all source code must ultimately be authored by you and reflect your own understanding.
    - If you include someone else’s code, even a small snippet, credit it properly.
      - Credit is necessary, but it does not make it acceptable to outsource major parts of the project.
      - Example: watching someone else build a frontend to learn is fine; submitting their work instead of your own is not.
  - Your project’s git commit history is the visible story of your progress.
    - Honest, incremental progress produces a clean, credible history. It is "showing your work".
    - Transparency matters: keep your repositories public (unless an exception is approved), maintain continuity, and use GitHub responsibly.
  - The only reliable way to succeed here is to make steady, original progress on your own work, with credit given where it is due.
  - Ethical expectations and obligations are spelled out in detail in the [ethics.md](../material/ethics.md) document. It describes ways to immediately fail the course. It is mandatory reading. All students will be assumed to have read it and to understand it.
