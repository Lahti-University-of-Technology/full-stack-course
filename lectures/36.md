# Week 36 - Full Stack Development

- **Welcome**
  - Instructor introduction
    - Who I am, background, interests, why I'm teaching
    - "Sergeant training officers"
  - **Course overview**
    - *"This course will teach you how to build software."*
      - Hard skills versus soft skills?
    - What full stack development means in this course
      - Terms: layers? stack? separation of concerns? backend? frontend? API? version control?
    - End results:
      - Build and own a full stack application
      - Understand how the frontend, backend, database, and deployment all fit together
      - Learn to use modern tools, workflows and technologies that professional developers rely on
      - Practice communicating your design and technical decisions clearly
    - Programming and development as creative expression
      - Creative and bold
      - Conservative and cautious
    - Self-learning course
      - see [resources](resources.md)
      - All engineers are self-taught
        - We encounter problems and propose solutions that have never been tried before, often under tight deadlines
        - It is a very fast-moving industry. All hard knowledge that I impart to you will be obsolete soon.
      - This course will not cover basic programming
  - Course philosophy
    - Ethics, people, principles first
    - More like a *studio class* than a seminar
      - Open-ended questions over rote memorization
      - Focus on exploration, design decisions, rationale, experimentation

- **Course Structure, Assignments and Grading**
  - Course Project
    - Milestones
    - Progress reports
      - Both on one's own project and on another student's
    - Code reviews
    - Weekly commits
    - Demos
    - Peer Evaluations
    - Presentation
  - Weekly seminars
    - Designed to introduce topics directly helpful to your project build
  - Weekly Assignments
    - Intended to be in support of course project
  - Semester Topic Report
    - Become a subject-matter expert on something related to Full Stack development, and communicate that knowledge to your fellow students.
  - Affinity group meetings

- **How to succeed in this course**
  - The course manual explains details, but here is the core idea.
  - Fair and correct work means your project and work is genuinely yours.
    - Use AI tools to explore, learn, write and accelerate — as long as you understand what they produce.
    - Ask friends for advice or to help you think through a problem — learning from others is part of the process.
    - Every assignment and all source code must ultimately be authored by you and reflect your own understanding.
    - If you include someone else’s code, even a small snippet, credit it properly.
      - Credit is necessary, but it does not make it acceptable to outsource major parts of the project.
      - Example: watching someone else build a frontend to learn is fine; submitting their work as your own is not.
  - Your project’s git commit history is the visible story of your progress.
    - Honest, incremental progress produces a clean, credible history. It is "showing your work".
    - Bursts of suspicious commit activity — such as repo resets, fabricated history, or unexplained gaps — undermine trust and may result in a zero.  
    - Submitting all work at the last minute is strongly discouraged. While not misconduct by itself, it often leads to mistakes, unstable code, and weaker evaluations.  
    - Transparency matters: keep your repositories public (unless an exception is approved), maintain continuity, and use GitHub responsibly.
  - The only reliable way to succeed here is to make steady, original progress on your own work, with credit given where it is due.
  - Ethical expectations and obligations are spelled out in detail in the [ethics.md](ethics.md) document. All students are assumed to have read and be familiar with it.

  - Submit *one deep question* you want answered about full stack development (due week 37)
    - Example questions (but you cannot use these):
      - How can full stack architectures scale from one user to millions?
      - What does it mean for an app to be secure across the stack?
      - Why is managing state across the stack so difficult?
