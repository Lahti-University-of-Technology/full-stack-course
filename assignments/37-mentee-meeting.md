# Meet with Your Mentee (First Meeting)

Your first task as a mentor is to meet with your assigned mentee. This meeting should happen early in the semester and last no less than a half hour.

[More information](/material/mentor-mentee.md)

## Purpose

- Learn about your mentee’s project concept and their goals for the course.
- Practice active listening: your role is to hear and capture, not to direct.

## Guidelines

- Experience levels may differ.  
  - If you have far less experience, you can still help by being a sounding board and reflecting back what you hear.  See [rubber-ducking](/material/rubber-ducking.md)
  - If you have more experience, resist the urge to give advice. Focus on listening. Save advice for after the meeting.
- Ask clarifying questions when needed, but let your mentee guide the conversation.  
- The mentee’s ideas, approach, and goals are the center of this session.

## Deliverable

Write a short summary (1–2 paragraphs):

- Paraphrasing your mentee's project idea and goals in your own words.  
- Record their approach, motivations, and concerns.  

This is a listening exercise, not a feedback session.
