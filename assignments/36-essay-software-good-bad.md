## Assignment: Good and Bad Uses of Software

**Due:** Week 36  
**Length:** 300–700 words  
**Format:** Plain text or PDF, submitted via Moodle

Software shapes the world — sometimes for the better, sometimes not. In this short essay, reflect on how software has affected your own life and the world around you. Address the following:

- What is an example of a **good use of software**? Why do you consider it good?  
- What is an example of a **bad use of software**? Why do you consider it bad?  
- Have you personally used software that had a **positive impact** on your life or work?  
- Have you encountered software that **frustrated**, **excluded**, or **harmed** you or someone you know?

You don’t need to do outside research. Just write from your own experience and observations. Be specific and concrete. 

### Purpose

This assignment helps you start thinking critically about the kind of software you want to build — and avoid building — during this course and beyond.
