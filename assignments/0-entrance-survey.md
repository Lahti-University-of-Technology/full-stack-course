# Full Stack Development Course – Entrance Survey

Please take a few minutes to answer these questions. Your responses will help me get to know you, understand where you’re coming from, and make the course more useful for you. Feel free to skip any question.

I may share **aggregated, anonymous** results from this survey with the class  
(for example: "20% of us are from Bangladesh" or "75% of us are inexperienced").

## Software Development Background

Give me some idea of what you have done before. This course has had successful students with an absolute lack of experience, so please do not be shy about that. If you are completely inexperienced, go ahead and ignore the last two questions.

- Describe your experience with software development (courses, projects, jobs, self-study).  
- Which languages, frameworks, or tools are you most eager to learn?  
- Which are you most comfortable with?  
- Which do you feel least confident in?
