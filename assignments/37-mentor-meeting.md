# Meet with Your Mentor (First Meeting)

Alongside serving *as* a mentor, you will also meet face-to-face with the person assigned as *your* mentor. This meeting should happen early in the semester and last about a half an hour.

## Purpose

- Share your project concept and your goals for the course.  
- Practice articulating your ideas clearly so that another person can understand them.  
- Experience what it’s like to be actively listened to.

## Guidelines

- Be open and specific about your goals. Explain not only *what* you want to achieve, but also *why* it matters to you.  
- Your mentor’s role is to listen and reflect, not to advise. Treat this as a chance to clarify your thinking out loud.  
- Don’t worry about having everything figured out. Early ideas, uncertainties, and rough sketches are welcome.

## Deliverable

Write a short reflection (1–2 paragraphs) that covers:

- When and where the meeting occurred.
- How clearly you felt you communicated your goals.  
- What you noticed about being listened to in this way.  
- Any new insights you gained by talking through your project.
