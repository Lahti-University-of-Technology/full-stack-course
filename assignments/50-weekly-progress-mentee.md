# Weekly Mentee Progress Report: Late version (Weeks 49 and 50)

Use this version in weeks 49 and 50 when projects may be behind schedule. The goal is clarity, triage, and a concrete path to finish. Keep tone factual and constructive.

If your mentee's project is *not* late, just note that (e.g. "Jane Doe's project is complete") and submit the report.

---

## Mentee Project Summary

- Mentee name
- Project name
- One-sentence description (in your own words)
- GitHub repo URL
- Netlify deploy URL

---

## Status at a glance

- Schedule status: On track, At risk, Off track  
- Primary blocker right now
- Predicted completion date for MVP
- Confidence level: High, Medium, Low

---

## Production Deploy

Open the production URL and describe what you see now (1 to 2 paragraphs). Include screenshots if helpful.

- Availability and basic health
- What works end to end
- Obvious defects or unfinished flows
- Differences from last week

**Evidence to attach or link**

- Current version or commit hash visible in the app if available
- Screenshot or short screen recording for the main flow

---

## GitHub Repository

Describe what you see now (1 to 2 paragraphs). Focus on objective signals.

- Latest commits with timestamps
- Commit rhythm this week and last week
- Active branches and open pull requests
- Whether work on branches is merged back to `main`

**Evidence to attach or link**

- Direct links to the last 5 to 10 commits
- List of open pull requests with titles
- Comparison view from last report tag or commit to current `main`

---

## Changes since last week

- What shipped to production
- What merged to `main`
- What is in a branch but not merged
- What was removed or descoped

If there is no visible change, describe the current project as if seeing it for the first time, then state how many weeks it has remained unchanged.

---

## Comparison to the roadmap

- Link to `roadmap.md`
- Which roadmap tasks are now complete
- Which tasks slipped and why
- New tasks discovered that were not on the roadmap
- Roadmap accuracy: Good, Partial, Outdated

---

## Critical path and risks

List only the tasks that must be completed to deliver the MVP.

- Critical path tasks with owners
- Dependencies that could block progress
- Risks and mitigations
- Decision logs that affect scope or timing

---

## Plan to finish

Re-baseline the plan for the remaining time.

- Must-ship features for MVP
- Quality gates that will not be waived (tests, accessibility, performance budget)
- Concrete next steps for the coming 3 to 5 days
- Target dates for each step
- Who will review or pair on each step

---

## Strengths

- What is working well in the mentee’s project
- Specific examples: design choice, commit quality, working feature, useful refactor

---

## Suggestions

- Where they can improve right now
- One or two high-leverage changes to unblock or accelerate
- Questions you would ask as a user or another developer

---

## Ask for help

If progress is stalled, specify the help needed.

- Clarify the request: code review, pairing, design decision, dataset access, deployment support
- Point to the exact file, endpoint, or branch
- Propose a time for a short session

---

## Reflections

- What you learned from reviewing their work this week
- Ideas you will apply to your own project

---

## For the mentor: tracking during late weeks

In weeks 49 and 50, mentors must track changes with extra discipline.

- Record meeting date, duration, and attendees
- Note the mentee’s current commit rhythm and deploy cadence
- Verify that the `roadmap.md` has been re-baselined to match reality
- Capture any scope cuts or deferrals and the reason
- List concrete commitments made before the next check-in
- If there is zero visible change for 2 weeks, escalate by scheduling a focused working session

---

## Optional templates

| Feature B | Defer | Not needed for demo |
| Feature C | Cut | Out of scope or too risky |

### Next steps checklist

- [ ] Task 1 with owner and target date
- [ ] Task 2 with owner and target date
