# Week 39 Assignment: Project Roadmap

By this stage, your design work should be quite mature and coding about to begin. To prepare for the next coalition meeting, you will create a **project roadmap** that breaks your project into smaller steps and sets a rough timeline.

## Purpose

The roadmap ensures you move into implementation with clarity. It will also give your coalition something concrete to respond to in Week 40, so you can refine your plan before coding accelerates.

## What to Include

Your roadmap should be no more than 2 pages and must include:

- **Tasks broken down** into smaller, achievable steps.  
  - Example: “Set up database schema” instead of “Build backend.”  
  - If you have API endpoints, implementing each one should be represented as a separate task.
  - It should be all of the tasks you anticipate must be done to get to MVP.
- **Order of execution**, showing what should be done first, next, later.  
- **Rough timing**, with target dates or weeks for each task or cluster of tasks.  
- **Dependencies**, noting tasks that rely on others being completed first.  
- **Stretch goals** (optional): features you would like to add if time allows.  

## Deliverable

- Submit your roadmap as a Markdown file in your project repository, named `roadmap.md`.  
- Be prepared to **present your roadmap** in the Week 40 coalition meeting. Your coalition will offer feedback and advice on how to refine it.  

Pro tip: Think of your roadmap as a practical guide for *yourself* — not a formal proposal. Write it so you can actually follow it when coding.
