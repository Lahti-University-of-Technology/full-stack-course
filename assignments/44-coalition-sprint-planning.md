# Week 44 Coalition Meeting

This meeting takes place just after the mid-semester break. Designs should be complete and coding well underway. The focus now is on planning the final push and keeping momentum strong. The meeting should last at least 1 hour but no more than 1.5 hours.

## Structure

1. **Stand-Up**  
   Begin with a short stand-up round (no more than 15 minutes). Each member shares:  
   - What they accomplished since the last coalition meeting.  
   - What they are working on now.  
   - Any blockers or obstacles in their way.  

2. **Roadmap Workshop**  
   Each member outlines the remaining tasks for their project. As a coalition:  
   - Help break down large tasks into achievable milestones.  
   - Identify dependencies or risks that could interfere with finishing.  
   - Push for concrete, time-bound goals that lead to project completion.  

   Pro tip: Make the roadmaps specific enough that you can check progress against them in the final coalition meeting.  

3. **Morale Check-In**  
   After roadmaps are shared, take time to reflect on energy and motivation.  
   - Share what’s been most encouraging so far.  
   - Surface any frustrations or fatigue.  
   - End by helping each member leave the meeting with renewed commitment.  

## Deliverable

- A coalition summary (submitted by one member on behalf of the group) that includes:  
  - A clear **roadmap for each member**, broken into milestones and target dates.  
  - Any **risks or dependencies** discussed.  
  - Notes from the **morale check-in** — highlights of what is keeping members motivated, and strategies for sustaining energy into the final push.
