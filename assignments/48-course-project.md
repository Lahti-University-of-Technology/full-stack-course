# Course Project

## Overview

The core of this course is a semester-long **full stack project**. You will **design, build, and deploy** a minimum viable product (MVP) that shows creativity, originality, and technical depth.  

The project is the single biggest part of your grade.

You will work individually, but you may exchange ideas, learnings, and tips with classmates. The goal is for you to **own a complete stack**: frontend, backend, database, and deployment.

---

## What the project must be

- **One purpose**  
  Your project should solve one problem or enable one activity.  

- **Well defined**
  The purpose should be easily stated in one or two sentences.

- **Original**  
  It cannot be a clone of an existing product.

- **Non-trivial**  
  It should not be a toy example or a single page script. It must show you can handle multiple layers of a real application.  

- **MVP first**  
  You do not need every feature. The requirement is a working minimum viable product: the smallest version of your app that delivers its core purpose to a real user.  

- **Approval**
  Your idea must be approved by the instructor.

## What the project must include

- A **frontend** where users interact with your application.  
- A **backend** that handles logic and data.  
- **Deployment** to the public internet.  
- **Source code** on GitHub with a visible history of progress.  
- Depending on the project, a **database** where data is stored and retrieved.  

---

## Documentation

- Your repository must include a `README.md` that clearly explains:
  - Project description
  - How to set it up locally  
  - How to use it  
  - Where it is deployed (URL)

- It must also include all **design artifacts** created during assignments and milestones, e.g.
  - Wireframes and wireflows
  - Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and Data flow diagrams (DFD)
  - Context Diagrams and component diagrams
  - etc.

---

## Process hygiene

- **Repository** must be public on GitHub, named `fsd-project-2025`.  
- **Commits** should be steady and incremental, not "big bang" uploads.  
- **Main branch** is the source of truth. Use feature branches if you want, but deploy from `main`.  
- **Commit messages** should describe intent ("Add login form") not filler ("fix", "wip").  
- **Tags/releases**: mark major milestones with a Git tag and short release notes.  
- **No resets**: do not delete and recreate repos, rewrite history, or make them private.  

---

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on:

- Functionality of your MVP  
- Originality and ambition of the idea  
- How well the full stack (frontend, backend, database, deployment) is implemented  
- Documentation quality and clarity  
- Clear and consistent GitHub history (steady, incremental commits)  
- Evidence of ethical and responsible progress
