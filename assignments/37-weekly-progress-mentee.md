# Weekly Mentee Progress Report

Each week submit a short report on your **mentee’s project**. This is to practice giving constructive feedback and to ensure everyone receives regular attention and support. For guidelines on how to write a helpful report, see below.

---

## Mentee Project Summary

- Mentee's name
- Project name  
- One-sentence description (in your own words)  
- GitHub repo
- Netlify deploy URL

---

### Production Deploy

Open the Netlify deploy URL in your browser and describe what you see in your own words (1-2 paragraphs).

### GitHub repository

Open the GitHub repository URL in your browser and describe what you see in your own words (1-2 paragraphs).

## Changes

What has changed since last week, both in source code, documentation and in the deploy?

## Strengths

- What is working well in your mentee’s project  
- Clear examples (design choice, commit quality, working feature, etc.)  

---

## Suggestions

- Where they could improve  
- Questions you would ask if you were the user or another developer  

---

## Reflections

- What have you learned from reviewing their work?
- What ideas or approaches might you apply to your own project?

## Guidelines for Writing the Mentee Report

These are guidelines for writing a helpful report.  The more information you can include, the better!

- Always give a clear snapshot of the project as it stands now.  
- When there is progress, describe what changed since last week and what seems to be improving.  
- **When there is no visible change:**  
  - Describe the project anew as if you are seeing it for the very first time.  
  - Write a short note that there has been no change for however many weeks (e.g. “No change for 2 weeks”).  
- Your goal is to give constructive feedback regardless of progress. This ensures your mentee still receives useful input, even if they are stuck or paused.

### What I Saw — Production Deploy

When describing your mentee’s live application, approach it like a first-time user and document what you observe:

- **Availability**
  - Does the production URL load?  
  - Is the site responsive on desktop and mobile?  

- **Landing page**
  - What is the first thing you see?  
  - Is the purpose of the application clear?  

- **Core functionality**
  - Try the main feature or flow. What happens?  
  - Do interactions (forms, buttons, navigation) respond as expected?  
  - Note any errors, dead ends, or unfinished flows.  

- **Visual presentation**
  - Is the layout usable and readable?  
  - Are there obvious issues with fonts, colors, or accessibility (e.g. contrast, missing labels)?  

- **Performance**
  - Does the app feel slow, fast, or unresponsive?  
  - Any obvious delays in loading or interaction?  

- **Consistency**
  - Compare with last week’s deploy: what’s new, what’s unchanged?  
  - If there is no change, describe the deploy as if you are seeing it for the first time, then state explicitly how many weeks it has remained the same.  

### Ways to explore the GitHub repository

When describing your mentee's GitHub repository, explore and document it using specific evidence. Here are useful approaches:

- **Commits**
  - Look at the most recent commit message and timestamp.  
  - Skim through a few commits: do they look incremental and meaningful, or large and vague?  
  - Note the frequency of commits (daily, weekly, gaps).  

- **Branches**
  - List active branches.  
  - Check whether development is happening only on `main` or if there are feature branches.  
  - See if branches are merged back or left stale.  
  - Is there a coherent [branching method or policy](/material/git-branching-policy.md)?

- **Codebase**
  - Open a file or two: does the code appear organized into folders and modules?  
  - Are there clear comments, README instructions, or documentation files?  
  - Look for presence of `/docs`, tests, or configuration files.  

- **Issues / Pull Requests**
  - Check if the project is using GitHub Issues or PRs.  
  - Note any open or recently closed items.  

- **Overall activity**
  - Compare the deploy with the repo: do commits line up with what is visible on production?  
  - If there is no change since last week, still describe the structure of the repo and code as if you are reviewing it for the first time, and then note how long it has been static.
