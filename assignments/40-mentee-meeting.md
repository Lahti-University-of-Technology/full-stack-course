# Meet with Your Mentee: Project Setup and Early Coding (Week 40)

At this stage, your mentee’s project design should be mature and coding underway. Your role is to observe closely and understand their process.

## Preparation

- Review your mentee’s project repository and deployed URL before the meeting.  
- Pay attention to:  
  - Frequency and rhythm of commits.  
  - Use of branches and pull requests.  
  - Overall clarity of the commit history.  

## Purpose

- Arrive ready to understand how your mentee has begun coding.  
- Watch as they walk you through their environment and early implementation.  
- Support by asking clarifying questions and reflecting back what you see.  

## Deliverable

Write a summary (3–4 paragraphs) that covers:  

- What you observed in their repository and deployment.  
- Key points you understood from their walkthrough.  
- Any clarifying questions you asked to better grasp their approach.
