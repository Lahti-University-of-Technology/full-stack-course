# Assignment: Good and Bad Uses of Software

**Length:** Short
**Format:** Plain text, submitted via Moodle

Software shapes the world, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. In this short essay, reflect on how software has affected your own life and the world around you. Address the following:

* What is an example of a **good use of software**? Why do you consider it good?
* What is an example of a **bad use of software**? Why do you consider it bad?
* Have you personally used software that had a **positive impact** on your life or work?
* Have you encountered software that **frustrated**, **excluded**, or **harmed** you or someone you know?

You donâ€™t need to do outside research. Just write from your own experience and observations. Be specific and concrete.

This assignment helps us to think critically about the kind of software we want to build, and avoid building, during this course and beyond.

NB: *Short* here means perhaps 300-500 words, but don't count the words.  Just really engage with the questions. At the end, I'd like your audience to know what makes software good in your experience?
