# Course Project Assignment

## Overview

The core of this course is a semester-long **full stack project**.  
You will **design, build, and deploy** a non-trivial application that demonstrates creativity, originality, and technical depth.  
The project is the primary component of your grade (70%).

You will work individually, but you may exchange ideas and tips with classmates.  
The goal is for you to **own a complete stack**: frontend, backend, database, and deployment.

---

## Constraints

- **Architecture**
  - Must be a full-stack application with a clear client and server.
  - Backend must use **Node.js** (JavaScript or TypeScript).
  - Frontend must use **Svelte** or **SvelteKit** by default; alternatives only if justified and approved.
  - Deployment must be public. Default is **Netlify** for serverless hosting.
- **Repository**
  - Hosted publicly on **GitHub**.
  - Repository must be named `fsd-project-2025`.
  - Repository history must be **incremental and transparent**.
    - Show your progress! No “big bang” commits. Commit regularly and incrementally.
    - No deleting or replacing repositories or changing them to private.
    - A sudden appearance of a finished project will fail the course.
- **Originality**
  - Project must not be trivial or a clone (e.g. no generic e-commerce, no blog engines).
  - It must have **one clear, defined purpose**.
  - Creative, whimsical, or bold ideas are encouraged.
- **Documentation**
  - A clear `README.md` is required, explaining purpose, setup, and usage.
- **Ethics**
  - Do not submit other people’s work as your own.
  - Your GitHub history is the record of your work.
  - Honesty and transparency matter more than perfection.

## Milestones

Progress is tracked weekly and through defined milestones.  
Your GitHub repository is the source of truth.

- **Week 36 – Project Setup**
  - Create `fsd-project-2025` repository.
  - Local setup with VS Code, GitHub CLI, and Netlify CLI.
  - Deploy “Hello World” site to Netlify.
- **Week 37 – Brainstorm & Choose Project**
  - Submit at least one original idea.
  - Finalize project selection.
- **Week 38 – Design User Experience**
  - Create wireframes / flowcharts of user interaction.
- **Week 39 – Plan Architecture**
  - Define frontend, backend, API, and database choices.
- **Week 40 – Initial Deployment**
  - Deploy basic frontend + backend integration.
- **Week 41 – Continuous Integration / Deployment**
  - Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Netlify integration).
- **Week 42–44 – Core Functionality**
  - Implement database and API.
  - Implement main frontend components.
- **Week 45 – Extended Features**
  - Add authentication, state management, or advanced features.
- **Week 46 – Refinement**
  - Testing, debugging, documentation.
- **Week 47 – Final Deployment**
  - Stable version live on Netlify.
- **Week 48 – Presentation**
  - Demonstrate and present your project to the class.

## Ethics

- Do not present other people’s work as your own.
  - You may use AI tools.
  - You may ask friends for advice or help understanding a problem.
  - But every assignment and all source code must be **authored by you**.
  - If you incorporate someone else’s code (even a small snippet), you must give proper credit.
    - Giving credit does not make it acceptable to outsource major parts of the project.
    - Example: having a friend write your frontend and then crediting them is **not acceptable**.
- Your project’s git commit history is a transparent record of your work
  - It cannot be faked
  - A sudden burst of commits producing a finished project is a red flag and will fail
  - Other red flags that indicate cheating include:
    - Deleting and recreating repositories
    - Getting banned from GitHub
    - Pointing course URLs to private repositories
  - The only way to have a clean history is steady, honest progress on your own original work

## Evaluation

- Clear and consistent GitHub history.
- Full stack design and implementation.
- Publicly accessible deployment.
- Secure handling of secrets.
- Non-trivial and original scope.
- Documentation and presentation quality.
- Evidence of steady, ethical progress.
