# Meet with Your Mentor: Project Setup and Early Coding (Week 40)

By this stage, your project design should be mature and coding should have begun. The focus now shifts from discussing ideas to actively showing and walking through your work. Bring your laptop, open it, and show your mentor what you have been doing.

## Purpose

- Give your mentor a clear view of your development environment and initial code.  
- Practice explaining your setup, design decisions, and first implementation steps.  
- Engage in a more hands-on interaction, such as walking through code or trying simple pair-programming.

## Guidelines

- Share your coding setup (editor, tools, repository).  
- Step your mentor through key parts of your code, explaining decisions and next steps.  
- Be ready to demonstrate a small feature or workflow in progress.  

## Deliverable

Write a reflection (5â€“7 paragraphs) on:  

- What you showed and explained.  
- How clearly you were able to communicate your setup and coding progress.  
- Any insights you gained from having to walk someone else through your environment and code.
