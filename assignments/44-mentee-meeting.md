# Meet with Your Mentee: Planning the Final Push (Week 44)

This meeting takes place right after the mid-semester break. Your role is to help your mentee clarify their remaining work, create a realistic roadmap, and leave the meeting with renewed energy.

## Preparation

- Review your mentee’s repository and deployment beforehand.  
- Note signs of progress since the last check-in: commits, branches, pull requests, and working features.  
- Be ready to highlight visible progress so your mentee sees how far they’ve come.  

## Purpose

- Listen as your mentee reviews what is done, in progress, and unfinished.  
- Ask questions to surface potential bottlenecks or overlooked tasks.  
- Encourage the mentee to break down their remaining work into milestones with target dates.  
- Reinforce morale by acknowledging progress and focusing on achievable next steps.  

## Deliverable

Write a short summary (1–2 paragraphs) that captures:  

- The roadmap your mentee set for finishing the project.  
- Any risks or bottlenecks you discussed.  
- How you supported their morale and confidence heading into the final push.
