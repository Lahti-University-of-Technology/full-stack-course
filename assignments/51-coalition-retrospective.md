# Week 51 Coalition Meeting

This final coalition meeting is a celebration of your work together. Projects are complete, and the focus now is on enjoying the groupâ€™s accomplishments and reflecting on the journey.

## Structure

1. **Celebrate**  
   Mark the end of the semester as a group. Bring snacks, take photos, tell stories, and enjoy the time together.

2. **Reflect Together**  
   Spend a few minutes talking about what the coalition added to your experience. Look back on highlights from the semester: moments of progress, funny mishaps, or times when the coalition helped push someone forward.
   - What worked best in supporting one another?  
   - What could future coalitions do differently?  

## Deliverable

- A brief coalition note (submitted by one member on behalf of the group) that answers two questions:  
  1. How did it go, as a group?  
  2. What advice would you give to future coalitions?  

  Keep it short and honest. The spirit of this meeting is celebration, not documentation.
