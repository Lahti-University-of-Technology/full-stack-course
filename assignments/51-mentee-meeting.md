# Meet with Your Mentee: Project Retrospective (Week 51)

This final meeting is a chance to help your mentee reflect on their completed project and the course as a whole. Your role is to guide them in revisiting their journey, successes, and challenges so they leave with a clear sense of what they accomplished and learned.

## Purpose

- Support your mentee in looking back on their project experience.  
- Remind them of both successes and difficulties they overcame.  
- Help them articulate their own understanding of what went well and what could have gone better.  

## Guidelines

- Ask open questions that encourage the mentee to think about their growth.  
- Reflect back the progress you saw across the semester.  
- Keep the focus on their voice: your role is to help them find clarity in their own reflections.  

## Deliverable

Write a short summary (1-2 paragraphs) that covers:  

- How your mentee described their successes and challenges.  
- Key themes or insights you noticed in their reflections.  

Also:

Append a retrospective (3-4 paragraphs) on your own mentorship: what worked well, what you might improve, and what you learned through the process.
