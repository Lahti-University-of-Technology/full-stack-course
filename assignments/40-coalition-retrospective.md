# Week 40 Coalition Meeting

By this point, design work should be mature and coding underway. This meeting shifts the coalition’s focus from planning to implementation: how their project’s design is being (or will be) realized in code.  At the end of the meeting, each member should have clear ideas and advice on how to move their specific designs to implementation.

Each member should bring their [Week 39 Project Roadmap](/assignments/39-project-roadmap.md) to present and refine.

Spend a few minutes agreeing on meeting format and length. It should be at least 1 hour long, but no more than 1.5 hours. Each student should have equal time and attention from the group, and projects presented at the end should have the same quality and focus of attention as the first.

## Structure

1. **Stand-Up**  
   Begin with a quick stand-up round (no more than 15 minutes). Each member shares:  
   - What they accomplished since the last coalition meeting.  
   - What they are working on now.  
   - Any blockers or uncertainties.  

2. **Design-to-Code Walkthroughs**  
   Each member presents their project.
   - Show current repository and deployment.  
   - Present your Week 39 roadmap.  
   - Highlight one or two concrete features or components tied directly to the design.  
   - Explain how design choices are shaping implementation decisions.  

   After each walkthrough, the group asks clarifying questions, offers observations, and gives advice on refining the roadmap into actionable coding steps.

3. **Focused Problem-Solving**  
   Select one or two blockers raised during the walkthroughs. Spend time as a group brainstorming practical ways forward — this may include resource suggestions, alternative approaches, or pairing up for support after the meeting.  

## Deliverable

- A coalition summary (submitted by one member on behalf of the group) that includes:  
  - For each member: a short paragraph on how their design is being translated into code.  
  - Updates or refinements made to each member’s roadmap during the meeting.
    - Summarize changes rather than restating the entire roadmap.  
  - Blockers identified during the meeting, clearly described.  
  - Specific advice or insights given to each member about implementing their design.  
  - Any peer commitments (e.g., “X will review Y’s API structure this week”).  

   Pro tip: Write the summary live during the meeting so details and advice are not lost.
