# Week 36 Coalition Meeting: Brainstorming Session

> A playful, fast-paced session to throw out wild ideas, maybe laugh, and kick off your coalition with energy.

A brainstorm is a fast-paced creative activity where the goal is to produce as many ideas as possible, without judgment. For this session, all ideas should relate in some way to potential full-stack application projects, no matter how unrealistic they may sound.

The ideas can be practical, ambitious, or even absurd. What matters is quantity and creativity, but not quality. If you do it right, expect most or all of the ideas to be ridiculous ("an app that matches socks by smell", "a dog food tasting competition app", "social media for babies", "dating app for pets").

This is the first coalition meeting of the semester. Your goal is to generate a pool of ideas quickly and collaboratively, setting the tone for open sharing throughout the course. The intent is human collaboration and getting to know your coalition, so digital tools and AI assistants are not invited. Put your digital devices away!

Any coalition member is free to use any of these ideas, or none of these ideas, for their own project.

## Structure

1. **Round-Robin Brainstorm**  
   Go around the circle in turn, each member quickly tossing out an idea for a full stack project.
   - Keep it quick and light, remember, the goal is quantity, not quality.  
   - Do not evaluate, critique, or claim ownership of ideas.  
   - Continue for as many rounds as it takes to have at least 25 ideas.
   - But if you're having fun, keep going!

   Pro tip: Don’t overthink it — the point is speed, spontaneity, and fun.  

2. **Collect and Record**  
   Write down every idea, no matter how wild, impractical, or silly it seems. The value comes from the range of ideas, not from picking “good” ones.  
   *Recording ideas can be challenging — see below for practical tips. Before you begin, choose a method. Feel free to modify if it's not working.*  

3. **Stop and Display**  
   Once the pool is full, stop. Make sure all of the ideas are on display in some way, either on a whiteboard or large notepad.

4. **Reflect**  
    As a group, look at the ideas together. Compare and contrast. Ask and answer questions like (but not limited to):
    - Which are the most fun or delightful?
    - Which are hidden gems, ideas that looks impractical but could be polished into a winning idea?
    - Vote as a group on one idea that, if you were working on a team, you would carry it further. The idea could be one that's modified from the original brainstorm.

5. **Discuss and develop that one idea**
   Spend a few minutes discussing how, practically, one might develop the idea.

6. **Name Your Coalition**  
   Every coalition will be referred to by a name of its own choosing. Select one together before the meeting ends.  
   - The name can be serious, playful, or absurd.  
   - Every member has **veto power** — the name must be something all agree on.  
   - Once chosen, this name will identify your coalition for the rest of the semester.  

## Idea Recording

The goal is to capture all ideas without slowing the pace. Choose a method that keeps the flow moving:

- **Whiteboard:** A classic option is one person is the scribe, whose job is to write down all ideas. The scribe may struggle to keep up.  
- **Rotating scribe:** One person writes each round, then passes the role along.  
- **Everyone writes:** Each member attempts to record every idea, then combine lists afterwords, filling in the gaps.  
- **Audio recording:** Record the session and transcribe it afterwords (e.g., with Whisper or ChatGPT). Be sure everyone speaks clearly. If you choose this method, consider a run-through before the session to make sure it works.

Whichever method you choose, make sure:  

- The fast pace is preserved.  
- No ideas are lost.  

## Deliverable

A coalition summary (submitted by one member on behalf of the group) that includes:  

- The full list of 25+ ideas generated.  
- The one idea you developed further as a group.  
  - A paragraph summarizing the practical considerations discussed for this idea.  
- Your coalition’s chosen name.  
- A short note on how the brainstorm felt to the group (energetic, difficult, fun, etc.).
